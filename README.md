ROADSAFE AI

ROADSAFE AI is an AI-based predictive tool designed to assess the risk of road accidents by analyzing various factors such as weather, road type, road conditions, traffic density, and time of day. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this tool identifies patterns in past accident data to forecast accident risk levels, helping to improve road safety.

Introduction

ROADSAFE AI is designed to provide actionable insights for improving road safety by predicting accident-prone conditions. Given historical data with labeled accident and non-accident events, ROADSAFE AI assesses current conditions to forecast the likelihood of an accident. This project is a part of a larger initiative to improve transportation safety in real-time by identifying high-risk scenarios.

Features

Weather Conditions: Considers weather-related factors (rain, fog, snow.).
Road Type: Distinguishes between types of roads (urban, rural, highway.).
Road Conditions: Analyzes current road surface and condition (dry, wet, icy).
Traffic Density: Estimates vehicle density on the road to assess accident risk.
Time of Day: Accounts for variations in risk based on the time (morning, afternoon, evening, night).

Data

The dataset used for this model includes features such as:
Weather
Road Type
Road Condition
Traffic Density
Time of Day
Additionally, historical accident data with labels indicating accident or non-accident events were used for training. This historical data aids in pattern recognition for predicting the probability of high-risk accidents in real-time conditions.

Model

The ROADSAFE AI model operates by:
Training on historical data: Recognizes patterns of high-risk events from past accident data.
Risk Assessment: Evaluates real-time input to predict if current conditions have a 'High Risk of Accident' or 'Low Risk of Accident.'
Model Pipeline
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and formats data, handles missing values, and normalizes inputs.
Feature Selection: Uses relevant features for risk prediction to enhance model efficiency.
Training: Trained on labeled accident and non-accident data.
Prediction: Maps conditions to risk levels based on feature similarity.
The model will output a risk level: High Risk of Accident or Low Risk of Accident.

Results

The model achieved significant accuracy in distinguishing high-risk from low-risk conditions during testing. Below are sample metrics:
Accuracy: 85%
Precision: 82%
Recall: 79%

Future Improvements

Future enhancements for ROADSAFE AI could include:
Integrating live data from sensors or API feeds for real-time predictions.
Expanding features to cover additional variables such as specific location-based patterns.
Improving model interpretability by visualizing the impact of each feature on risk prediction.

The ROADSAFE AI project aims to deliver accurate predictions to promote safer driving conditions and decrease accident rates.
